Extracting Text from PDF
Before Extracting text from the pdf file install the basic libraries like pyPDF2 or Pdfquery
write pip install pypdf2 #for pyPDF2 libraries
write pip install pdfquery #for pdfquery libraries
Before loading the file in pdf format using either of the above option, the file must be saved in the folder of the jupyter notebook directory else the program will show error.
Also, do not convert a pdf file directly into text format because direct conversion in the text format may lead to absence of certain important text.
Therefore, always convert the file either in HTML format of XML and then convert it into text format.
